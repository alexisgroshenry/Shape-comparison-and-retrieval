# Shape-comparison-and-retrieval
Comparing the performances of two methods for shape comparison and retrieval for a query 3D shape among a given 3D shapes dataset : GPS vs Shape-DNA.

- Computation of the eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the input 3D shape using Arnoldi method
- Computation of the GPS values using these eigenvalues
- Classification of datasets using kNN for the two computed signatures
